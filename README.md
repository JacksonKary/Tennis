# CSCI 1133 Project - Tennis

This interactive tennis game was one of the first programming projects I ever created. It is currently a single-player game, although it could be two-player if both players are using the same keyboard. There are multiple different shot types which reflect real life tennis strokes. It's a little buggy, so I might revisit it. I hope it's fun!
